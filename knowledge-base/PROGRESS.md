# PROGRESS.md — knowledge-base self-improvement tracker

The single source of truth for what's mapped, what's stale, and what to do next. Each hourly tick reads this first (PART 3 of LOOP.md), advances one meaningful step, then updates this file. Keep it honest and high-signal.

Legend: **Mapped** = done & verified · **Partial** = started, needs deepening/verification · **TODO** = not started.

## Mapped
- `knowledge-base/mcp-servers.md` — now a thin **index/pointer** into `mcp/` (server → file map + deferred-tools caveat); full detail lives in the per-server files.
- `knowledge-base/accounts-and-stations.md` — comms identities (XMTP/Discord/Telegram) + stations + per-station capabilities (public IDs only).
- `knowledge-base/repos-and-infra.md` — repos, local paths, relayer/monitoring/deploy infra.
- `knowledge-base/socials-and-external.md` — reach + X/Typefully/JARVIS.
- Top-level structure: `README.md`, `INDEX.md`, `STATUS.md`, `reports/`, `contacts/`, `skills/`, `preferences/`, `memory/`.
- `knowledge-base/mcp/` — per-MCP tool-by-tool files: `metro.md`, `snapshot.md`, `better-stack.md`, `zapier.md`, `sentry.md`, `tenderly.md`, `notion.md`, `intercom.md`, `netlify.md`, `fireflies.md`, `snapshot-mysql.md` **Done** (real read-only calls captured); `oauth-gated-and-misc.md` (Cloudflare/Calendly/Docusign/Slash/Browserbase) **Done (schema-only)**; `google-workspace.md` **Done (2026-06-28, structure-only)**. Index in `mcp/README.md`. Per-MCP map complete.
- `knowledge-base/built-in-tools.md` **Done (2026-06-27)** — non-MCP harness tool catalog (Agent + sub-agent types, Bash/Read/Write/Edit, ToolSearch, Skill, Monitor/WebSearch/WebFetch, SendMessage/TaskStop/Worktree) + the available Skill list.
- `mcp/snapshot-mysql.md` (2026-06-27) — Snapshot_MySQL REACHABLE: read-only `snapshot-hub@replica`, 12 tables; proposals (34c) + votes (15c, PK voter+space+proposal) schema captured (names only, NO rows). Distinct from the mana/PlanetScale relayer DB.
- `mcp/oauth-gated-and-misc.md` (2026-06-27) — **Slash** REACHABLE (banking/spend API, 100+ endpoints, financial PII → only `GET /tokens/prices` safe-public, not exercised); **Cloudflare/Calendly/Docusign** OAuth-gated (auth NOT started, verify in main); **Browserbase** tools listed but no session opened.
- `knowledge-base/channels/` Discord rosters — **ALL known Discord lines verified 2026-06-27** via metro `read`: SX Ledger thread `1517956186929102869`, #api `1030772407226601522`, interns `1478881436168880218`, plus the last two `1125390177888645231` (team/payment-feed: Less+Amalio+Metro, snapshot/Schnaps bots) and `1508453453930692669` (1:1 DM tonyshot26↔Metro, setup/onboarding). No `(unverified)` Discord rows remain.
- **Per-MCP capability map — COMPLETE (2026-06-27)**, now ongoing-maintenance. All reachable servers mapped tool-by-tool in `mcp/`; only `google-workspace.md` remains a deliberate (privacy) stub.
- **STRUCTURE/REFACTOR pass — DONE (2026-06-27, post-1010).** `INDEX.md` now links EVERYTHING (README/LOOP/STATUS/PROGRESS, all top-level KB files, `mcp/` + every per-server file, `channels/`, `built-in-tools.md`, all skills/preferences/memory files, contacts/README + each contact, reports/). `mcp-servers.md` demoted to a thin **index/pointer** into `mcp/` (de-duplicated; no info lost). `knowledge-base/README.md` Files table extended (mcp/, built-in-tools.md, channels/). Contacts ↔ channels cross-linked **both ways** (each trusted-5 contact got a "Key channels" block; `channels/README.md` roster already points to contacts/ files).

> Key per-server findings (Notion live teamspace `General` + Fabien/bots; Intercom workspace `n9dmxtcs`/59 articles; Netlify 3 teams incl. stagelabs→stage.box + snapshotlabs→11 SX sites; Sentry org `snapshot-labs`/16 projects/NO mana; Tenderly default project + ~100 chains; Zapier none-enabled; Snapshot_MySQL `snapshot-hub@replica`/12 tables) live in the respective `mcp/*.md` files — no longer duplicated here.

## Partial / open
- **`knowledge-base/channels/`** — index + **all known Discord lines verified (2026-06-27)**; cross-linked to contacts/. No unverified Discord rows remain. Optional next: split high-traffic channels into per-channel files.
- **`knowledge-base/mcp/google-workspace.md`** — **DE-STUBBED 2026-06-28** (structure-only). Drive left schema-only by choice (file names sensitive). Nothing further needed.

## TODO
- Nothing net-new outstanding. (All Discord lines now verified.) Optionally de-stub Google Workspace, then operate in maintenance mode (re-verify drifted facts; keep STATUS/reports fresh).

## Next focus (for the next tick)
**ONGOING MAINTENANCE + VERIFICATION** (per-MCP map + built-in catalog + structure pass all complete):
1. ~~Verify the 2 remaining Discord lines~~ **DONE 2026-06-27** (`1125390177888645231` team/payment-feed; `1508453453930692669` tonyshot26↔Metro DM). All Discord lines verified.
2. ~~Optional Google Workspace de-stub~~ **DONE 2026-06-28** (structure-only; Gmail no custom labels, 2 calendars). KB mapping now 100% complete — pure maintenance mode.
3. **Re-verify drifted facts** rather than net-new mapping: confirm IDs/dashboards/sources still valid, prune anything stale, keep STATUS/reports fresh.
No net-new mapping is outstanding — treat the KB as in maintenance mode.
